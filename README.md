# üéÑ Advent of Code 2023 üéÖ

Advent of code is an annual event that takes place in December. It involves solving a series of interesting and challenging problems created by Eric Wastl. The event is hosted at [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

**Java version used:** 17.0.4

## Setup
* Each day's challenge is located in its own directory (day01, day2, etc.). Inside each directory, there is a 'Challenge.java'
* You can find the input files for each day using the links provided in the Challenge Status
* This project uses Gradle for build automation. To run the challenge for a specific day, execute its corresponding Gradle task. You can do so as follows for day01 (The command is same for other days, you only need to change the respective day number):
    ### macOS or Linux
    ```bash
    ./gradlew runDay01
    ```
    
    ### Windows
    ```bash
    gradlew.bat runDay01
    ```
